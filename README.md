# randomize your decision

In order to help people whom struggle with indecisions throughout their life, this code was implemented. The idea is that people who have some kind of problem in taking decisions, can use it to choose one of all the options. The probability of each decision can be equally distributed, or you can give more to decisions which you are more leaned. 

## who it works

The code can be divided in 4 steps

### Step 1

Insert the question you are struggling with

### Step 2

Insert the number of decisions this question has

### Step 3

Now insert the decisions accordingly with the number of questions inputed before

### Step 4

Now will be asked if each of the options has the same probability of happening. If yes, then the decision will be generated. If no, then you will have to input the probability of each one of the options. 

### Step 5

Now you can check your decision to be taken.
